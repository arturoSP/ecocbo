Description: A system for calculating the optimal sampling effort, based on the ideas of 
    "Ecological cost-benefit optimization" as developed by A. Underwood (1997, 
    ISBN 0 521 55696 1). Data is obtained from simulated ecological communities with
    prep_data() which formats and arranges the initial data, and then the 
    optimization follows the following procedure of four functions: (1) prep_data()
    takes the original dataset and creates simulated sets that can be used as a 
    basis for estimating statistical power and tipe II error. (2) sim_beta() is used
    to estimate the statistical power for the different sampling efforts specified
    by the user. (3) sim_cbo() calculates then the optimal sampling effort, based
    on the statistical power and the sampling costs. Additionally, (4) scompvar() 
    calculates the variation components necessary for (5) Underwood_cbo() to calculate
    the optimal combination of number of sites and samples depending on either 
    an economic budget or on a desired statistical accuracy. Lastly, (6) plot_power() 
    helps the user visualize the results of sim_beta().
