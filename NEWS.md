# ecocbo 0.10.2

# ecocbo 0.10.1
- We added '\\donttest{}' to the 'sim_beta()' example in the DESCRIPTION file because it takes more than 5 seconds to run. Changing the parameter values to make the function run faster would not be instructional to the final user, as it would not demonstrate the function's actual runtime and functionality. The example code will not be run automatically, but it can still be run manually if desired.

# ecocbo 0.9.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
