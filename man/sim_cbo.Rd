\title{Cost-Benefit Optimization for Sampling Effort}
\usage{
sim_cbo(data, cn, cm = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Object of class \code{"ecocbo_beta"}, as returned by
\code{\link{sim_beta}}.}

\item{cn}{Numeric. Cost per sampling unit.}

\item{cm}{Numeric. Fixed cost per replicate.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per candidate design. In the single factor
case, the results include the available \code{n} values, their statistical
power and cost. For the nested symmetric experiments, the results include all
the available values for \code{m}, the optimal \code{n}, according to the
power, and the associated cost. The results also mark a suggested sampling
effort, based on the cost and power range as selected by the user.
}
\description{
Given a table of statistical power estimates produced by \code{\link{sim_beta}},
\code{sim_cbo} finds the sampling design (number of replicates/site and sites)
that minimizes total cost while achieving a user‚Äêspecified power threshold.
}
\examples{
# Optimization of single factor experiment
sim_cbo(data = epiBetaR, cn = 80)

# Optimization of a nested factor experiment
sim_cbo(data = betaNested, cn = 80, cm = 180)
